          <td> <strong> Villa Italia </strong> <br /> Whereas Coppi delivers contemporary Italian, Villa Italia takes a more traditional approach. Inside, the restaurant is styled to replicate a beautiful Italian villa with a ceiling lit up by stars creating a Mediterranean homely ambiance. Whilst the pizzas are spectacular, for me the real stars are their poultry dishes which come in various indulgent sauces with garlic potato cubes and buttery veg to dip in, just heaven! <br/ > http://villaitaliarestaurant.co.uk/ <br /> </td>

With a menu that constantly evolves depending on the catch of the day, whilst you can’t be promised to eat the same dish twice, you can always expect to be blown away!
